NOTE 1 [file 02_nvt.mdp]:
  verlet-buffer-pressure-tolerance is ignored when verlet-buffer-tolerance
  < 0

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Other is 30.00

NOTE 2 [file 02_nvt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 1 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Update groups can not be used for this system because the construction atoms of a virtual site are only partly with a group of constrained atoms
