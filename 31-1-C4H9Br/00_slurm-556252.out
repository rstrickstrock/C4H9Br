Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 39.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file 01_emin.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
