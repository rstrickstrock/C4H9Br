Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 5415.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file 01_emin.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.

GROMACS reminds you: "Scientists do not join hands every Sunday and sing "Yes gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down, down, down. Amen!" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about the concept." (Dan Barker)
